          <h5>Rick C-137</h5>
          <p>Ryan's team is looking more and more like the real deal every week. That's why his rick is the real OG Rick. Can anyone beat him? I think so, but maybe he will prove me wrong.</p>

          <p>Joey's team is also looking like the real deal, but it's not. That's why he gets Rick C-132, the Rick that we saw in a few episodes in the 2nd season. It's the alternate rick. We'll see if his team can keep performing in this week's game of the week.</p>

          <p>Look at me! I'm Tiny Rick!!!! My team is on the uprising, with a couple solid weeks. Although, my team will more than likely suck ass in a couple weeks, and like Tiny Rick, will want to sabatoge myself.</p>

          <p>Brendan is 4-1 with a couple easy wins under his belt. He's also in the Navy so I was obligated to give him SEAL Team Ricks. Brendan's team could shape up to be decent, and make a run in the playoffs.</p>

          <h4>Previous Week: #6</h4>
          <h5>Simple Rick</h5>
          <p>Fife's team is Simple Rick because North Dakotan's enjoy the simple things in life, and come home to enjoy "sweet taste of Simple Ricks&trade;". Fife's team is pretty decent, as is the simple life.</p>

          <h4>Previous Week: #4</h4>
          <h5>Morty Rick</h5>
          <p>Morty Rick is combo of Rick and Morty, just like Dexy's team is a combo of a good and a bad team. A couple solid wins, and a rough loss last week. As the season progresses, Will Dexy's team turn into a Rick team, or a Morty team? I'm not sure.</p>

          <h5>Rick D. Sanchez III</h5>
          <p>Kevin's team had its first Win last week, and scored the most points. Just goes to show, that anyone can get lucky, like Rick D. Sanchez III. Although he is only 1-4, if Deshaun Watson can keep his team afloat, he may end up making the playoffs.</p>

          <h4>Previous Week: #3</h4>
          <h5>Cronenberg Rick</h5>
          <p>Dropping dow 5 spots from the #3 spot is about as bad as being Cronenberg Rick. Just messed up beyond recognition, like Eric's team. There's no turning around at this point. His team will likely live happily ever after in mediocrity.</p>

          <h4>Previous Week: #7</h4>
          <h5>Council of Ricks</h5>
          <p>Another year of fantasy football, another pathetic team from David. Just like the Council of Ricks, who seem to "not get it"; David does not seem to "get" fantasy football. He's also in law school and was in student "council", so it's obvious that he's Council of Ricks.</p>

          <h4>Previous Week: #9</h4>
          <h5>Evil Rick</h5>
          <p>Luke's team can't catch a break. Overall not that bad of a performance week after week, but 1-4 does not get you into the playoffs. Evil Rick fits his team as Evil Rick did not make the playoffs (??? I can)</p>

          <h4>Previous Week: #11</h4>
          <h5>Doofus Rick</h5>
          <p>Yet again another sub-par team. Last week, KC's team did not show up. She must've felt like Doofus Rick her team's performance this week. I would rank her last after looking at her roster, but Nick's team is even worse. Hopefully, she can turn around her season with some waiver wire pick ups, but everyone knows only doofus' are left on the wire.</p>

          <p>Nick's team is god awful. Just like the idea of pickle rick was. There is no hope for is team, as is there no hope for Pickle Rick to be funny. He would probably be better off just giving up and selling some of his players under the table for bad trades. That's the only way nick will make any money off of this team.</p>
